 JoynmeNotificationDemo class provides examples of various uses of the JoynmeNotifications package 
  
 NotificationViewFactory is main factory class that is used to show dropdown notifications.
 
 Notification is shown at the top of the provided parent component (must be RelativeLayout).
 After notification hides back it removes itself from the parent so you don't have 
 to worry about the cleanup. 
  
 There are two ways to show notification:
  
     1. By providing predefined notification type: INFO_NOTIFICATION, WARNING_NOTIFICATION, etc.
     
     2. By providing custom notification component (must be of NotificationLayout class).
        NotificationLayout is just a subclass of RelativeLayout, see for example
        res/layout/dropdown_custom_layout.xml
  
 You can also provide optional OnTapListener and/or OnSwipeListener to handle cases when 
 some non-trivial action is needed when user Taps or Swipes notification panel. Default 
 actions for Tap and Swipe are to immediately hide notification.
