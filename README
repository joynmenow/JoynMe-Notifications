 NotificationViewFactory is main factory class that is used to show dropdown notifications.
 
 Notification is shown at the top of the provided parent component (must be RelativeLayout).
 After notification hides back it removes itself from the parent so you don't have 
 to worry about the cleanup. 
  
 You can also provide optional OnTapListener and/or OnSwipeListener to handle cases when 
 some non-trivial action is needed when user Taps or Swipes notification panel. Default 
 actions for Tap and Swipe are to immediately hide notification.
